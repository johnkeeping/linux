Virtual-Mux:

Virtual-Mux provided a mechanism for switching between device tree overlays
without permitting arbitrary configurations to be loaded.  All supported
overlays are specified as subnodes of the mux device.

Required properties:

- compatible: "virtual-mux"

Optional properties:

- default-state: name of the state to select at startup.  If this is not
  specified then the first state will be selected.
- switch-delay-ms: delay to insert after disabling the old state before
  the new one is activated.  If this is not specified then no delay will
  be used.
- post-switch-delay-ms: delay to wait after activating a state before it
  may be disabled again.  If this is not specified then no delay will be
  used.

State subnodes:

Each subnode must have a name prefixed by "state-", the remainder of the
node's name is the name of the state.  The subnodes of a state node are
overlay fragments as described in overlay-notes.txt.

Example:

	xyzmux: mux@0 {
		compatible = "virtual-mux";
		default-state = "internal";

		state-internal {
			fragment@0 {
				target = <&sdmmc>;
				__overlay__ {
					/delete-property/ wp-gpios;
					disable-wp;
					pinctrl-names = "default";
					pinctrl-0 = <&sdmmc_select_internal>;
					status = "okay";
				};
			};
		};

		state-external {
			fragment@0 {
				target = <&sdmmc>;
				__overlay__ {
					pinctrl-names = "default";
					pinctrl-0 = <&sdmmc_select_external>;
					status = "okay";
				};
			};
		};
	};
